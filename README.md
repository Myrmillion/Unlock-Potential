Typically, throughout this application, the following informations and sensors of the phone will be utilized :

- **Device information** (phone model, phone manufacturer, system version, etc).
- **Sensors** (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer).
- **Batery information** (battery level, save mode activation status and battery status).
- **Package information** (app name, package name, app version, build number, etc).

And, as such, this project makes use of the following plugins in order to access the aformentioned phone capabilities :
